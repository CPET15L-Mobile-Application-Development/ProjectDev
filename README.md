## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Charon
Charon is a powerful game library application that empowers you to effortlessly manage, create, and delete your games. It provides a user-friendly interface to streamline your game collection organization. The application consists of different pages/views for navigation, including Home, List, Account, and About. These pages offer various previews and functions for you to explore.

## ‚úÖ Features
* **Seamless Game Management:** Easily add, remove, and track your games. This empowers users to create and manage their own custom game libraries within the application.
* **Intuitive Interface:** A navigation bar provides easy access to different views (home page, list page, account page, and about page). Additionally, the dark mode option allows users to browse the application comfortably for extended periods without eye strain.
* **Efficient Organization:** This game application allows users to view their game library in a well-organized manner, typically categorized by genre, pricing, and popularity. The application offers two pleasing organizational views: collection and list. This flexibility allows users to browse and search for their favorite games efficiently.
* **Login & Register:** Users can log in to existing accounts or register for new accounts.

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To create and build programs, we developers use Xamarin, which is integrated with Visual Studio Code. Xamarin utilizes both XAML for the front-end design (GUI) and the C# language for the "code-behind" functionality that handles the application's logic. The integrated development environment (IDE) Visual Studio Code allows us to debug, modify, and deploy the application easily due to its comprehensive and centralized features.

### Installation
The application is currently available in a release on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CPET15L-Mobile-Application-Development/ProjectDev.git). This release includes a single application installable only on Android devices in the .apk format. An iOS version will be available in a future patch.

We plan to upload the application to the Google Play Store or App Store to provide a verified and secure download with a legitimate certificate. This will allow users to download the application safely without relying on third-party installers.

## Usage

### ‚úèÔ∏è Managing Games

#### ‚ûï Adding Games
To add a game to their library, users can navigate to the "List Page" by clicking the navigation icons at the bottom of the screen. A "+" symbol button in the bottom right corner indicates the option to add a new game. Clicking this button will display a pop-up window (push modal) where you can fill in the required fields and upload an image for your chosen game.

#### ‚ûñ Deleting Games
To delete a game, in the game list you can swipe right of the list view items. This will show an underlay of options which are the modify and delete. If the user wishes to delete this the item will be deleted once the user clicked the button. Note that this change cannot be reverted back, or else you will need to re-add the item to the library.

## üßë‚Äçüíª The Developers

### Joey Boy Mission
I am a 3rd-year undergraduate student at the Technological University of the Philippines, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering Technology Major in Computer Engineering Technology. I developed this application as part of the requirements of the course Mobile Application Programming and Design under the guidance of Prof. Ramel Dumosdos.

Driven by a passion for technology, particularly network engineering, computer engineering, and entrepreneurship, I am an aspiring full-stack developer. The dream, of course, is to head a large tech company, but for now, the objective remains to accumulate experience and skills.

To my family - Emily and Prince, my loved one - Chin.

### Michael Angilo Pancho
I am a 21-year-old third-year college student at the Technological University of the Philippines - Manila. I am passionate about technology and aspire to become a software engineer, network engineer, or entrepreneur. Currently, I am developing an innovative app for my Mobile Programming subject, guided by Mr. Ramel Dumosdos. This project allows me to apply and expand my skills in mobile app development, bringing me closer to my career goals.

I am committed to continuously learning and improving my technical skills. Through dedication and hard work, I aim to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. My journey is fueled by the desire to acquire the expertise necessary for success in my chosen field, and I am excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead.
