## About Charon {#about-charon}

Charon is a powerful game library application that empowers you to effortlessly manage, create, and delete your games. It provides a user-friendly interface (details on the interface type can be filled in here) to streamline your game collection organization.

## Features {#features}

* **Seamless Game Management:** Easily add, remove, and track your games. This empowers users to create and manage their own custom game libraries within the application.
* **Intuitive Interface:** A navigation bar provides easy access to different views (home page, list page, account page, and about page). Additionally, the dark mode option allows users to browse the application comfortably for extended periods without eye strain.
* **Efficient Organization:** This game application allows users to view their game library in a well-organized manner, typically categorized by genre, pricing, and popularity. The application offers two pleasing organizational views: collection and list. This flexibility allows users to browse and search for their favorite games efficiently.
